    <br>
    I am a PhD Candidate in Social Data Science at the <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>, as an ESRC and Nuffield College Scholar.
    <br>
    My research focuses on computational text analysis and political polarisation, using machine learning, natural language processing, network analysis, and time-series.
    <br>
    Alongside my PhD, I collaborate with Oxford’s Development Institute and Department of Politics, and Science Po’s Centre for European Studies and Comparative Politics.
    <br>
    Previously, I completed an MPhil in Politics (Oxford, 2021) and a BA in Politics and International Relations (Exeter, 2019).
